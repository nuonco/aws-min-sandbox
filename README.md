# Nuon AWS Empty Sandbox

This is a baseline sandbox that provides a bare minimum AWS environment for use with Nuon.

It includes outputs required for Nuon to function.

Updated 2025-08-21 to let an AWS Lambda app config work correctly. See the [example-app-configs](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs) repository for more information and other app configs.
